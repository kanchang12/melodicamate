Privacy Policy — MelodicaMate

Effective date: 30 Dec 2025

MelodicaMate (“the app”) is an early-stage learning tool that helps users practice music with real-time feedback. We take privacy seriously and aim to collect as little data as possible.

1) What data the app uses
Microphone (Audio Input)

MelodicaMate requires microphone access to analyze live playing or singing.

Audio is used to detect pitch/notes and provide feedback.

We do not store raw microphone recordings by default.

2) What data we store
Local Device Storage

The app may store the following only on your device:

selected settings (e.g., key, notation mode)

practice session summaries (e.g., detected notes)

daily usage timer (e.g., minutes used today)

This data is stored locally using on-device storage and is not shared unless you choose to share it.

3) What data may be sent to our server

When you request AI coaching or voice feedback, the app may send non-audio session information to a backend service, such as:

detected note events (e.g., MIDI note numbers, timestamps, confidence)

selected exercise, key, and mode

basic performance metrics (e.g., accuracy estimate)

a flag indicating suspected recorded audio (to enforce app rules)

Important: We do not need raw audio to provide coaching. The app is designed to send only small structured data.

4) Third-party services

MelodicaMate may use third-party APIs to generate coaching text and voice responses:

Google Gemini (Google Cloud) — used to generate short coaching feedback based on your performance metrics

ElevenLabs — used to convert coaching text into spoken audio

These services may process the data sent to them according to their own privacy policies. We only send the minimum data needed to provide the requested feature.

5) Recorded music restriction

To respect copyright and reduce misuse, MelodicaMate is designed for live input (singing, humming, or playing). If input appears to be a recorded song, the app may refuse to analyze it.

6) Analytics and tracking

MelodicaMate does not use advertising trackers.
If analytics are added in the future, this policy will be updated and users will be informed.

7) Data retention

Practice data stored locally stays on your device until you uninstall the app or clear its storage.

Server requests are processed to deliver responses and are not intended for long-term storage. (This may evolve as the product matures; any changes will be reflected here.)

8) Children’s privacy

MelodicaMate is not designed specifically for children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe a child has provided personal data, please contact us and we will address it.

9) Your choices

You can:

deny microphone permission (the app will not be able to listen)

uninstall the app to remove locally stored data

disable voice features if available in settings

10) Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy as the product evolves. The effective date will be updated accordingly.
